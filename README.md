This GSAP project is a learning-focused animation playground where I practice building smooth scroll-based effects, responsive navigation bar animations, 
and small UI micro-interactions. It includes experiments with timelines, easing, and trigger-based motion to make page movement feel natural and polished. 
The main goal is to understand how real-world web animations are structured—keeping them clean, reusable, and performance-friendly—while improving the overall user experience through subtle, 
modern interactions.
